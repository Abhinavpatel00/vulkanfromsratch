# Extended Game Design: "Havenwood" - A Cozy Collaborative Building Game

## Core Vision
Havenwood is a peaceful, vegan-friendly multiplayer world where players collaborate to build charming settlements in harmony with nature. Thousands of cute animals roam freely through player-created landscapes, creating a living, breathing ecosystem that responds to player actions.

## Core Gameplay Pillars

### 1. Cozy Building & Terraforming (Tiny Glade Inspired)
- **Organic Building System**: Structures grow and form naturally rather than appearing instantly
- **Intuitive Terraforming**: Sculpt terrain with gesture-based controls that feel like gardening
- **Living Architecture**: Buildings develop character over time - vines grow on walls, birds nest in eaves
- **Seasons System**: Environment changes visually and mechanically with seasons (snow in winter, blossoms in spring)

### 2. Thriving Ecosystem (Thousands of Animals)
- **Animal Personalities**: Each animal has unique behaviors, preferences, and relationships
- **Ecosystem Simulation**: Animals interact with each other and player creations (deer graze, rabbits burrow, birds perch on structures)
- **Rescue & Rehabilitation**: Players help injured animals and provide habitats for endangered species
- **Animal Friends**: Befriended animals provide benefits (squirrels help find resources, owls deliver messages)

### 3. Collaborative Multiplayer
- **Shared World Building**: Players work together on community projects (bridges, parks, temples)
- **Specialization Roles**: Players can focus on different aspects (gardening, architecture, animal care)
- **Non-Competitive Progression**: Advancement through creating beauty and helping others
- **Neighborhood System**: Group territories with shared resources and bonuses

### 4. Social Hub & Sharing (Township Inspired)
- **Weekly Markets**: Player-organized markets to trade rare items and show off creations
- **Blueprint Sharing**: Share building designs through an in-world library system
- **Visitor Mode**: Visit other players' worlds to get inspiration and leave gifts
- **Community Goals**: Server-wide projects that unlock new areas and rewards

### 5. Gentle Progression (Clash of Clans Inspired)
- **Season Pass Alternative**: "Growth Journal" that tracks peaceful accomplishments
- **Prestige System**: Prestiging resets certain progress but grants unique cosmetic rewards
- **Resource Management**: Renewable resources that require nurturing rather than exploitation
- **Technology Tree**: "Wisdom Tree" focused on ecological knowledge and building techniques

## Detailed World Systems

### Living World Systems
- **Dynamic Weather**: Rain helps plants grow, snow allows for special activities
- **Day/N Cycle**: Different animals and activities appear at different times
- **Plant Propagation**: Plants naturally spread based on environmental conditions
- **Firefly Shows**: Nightly events where players can gather to watch synchronized firefly displays

### Animal Behavior System
- **Complex Needs System**: Animals have dietary, habitat, and social needs
- **Migration Patterns**: Herds move between areas based on season and player development
- **Reproduction**: Animals naturally breed when conditions are right (visual only, no exploitation)
- **Rescue Missions**: Find and help injured animals during weather events

### Building & Crafting
- **Material Gathering**: Resources regenerate naturally and can be cultivated
- **Cooperative Building**: Multiple players can work on large structures simultaneously
- **Blueprint Creation**: Save and share building designs with the community
- **Eco-Friendly Upgrades**: Structures can be enhanced with living roofs, bird houses, etc.

### Social Systems
- **Non-Verbal Communication**: Extensive emote system and visual signals for cross-language play

## Technical Considerations for Future Expansion
- **Ray Tracing Ready**: Architecture designed for easy integration of both compute and native ray tracing
- **Cross-Platform Play**: Designed from ground up for PC and eventual console release
- **Scale Management**: Systems to handle thousands of entities without performance issues
- **Cloud Syncing**: Player creations and world state saved across devices

## Art Style & Atmosphere
- **Warm Color Palette**: Rich greens, warm browns, soft pastels
- **Soft Lighting**: Global illumination with gentle shadows
- **Subtle Animations**: Leaves rustle, water ripples, structures sway gently

This design focuses on creating a peaceful, collaborative experience that emphasizes creativity, community, and connection with nature - a vegan-friendly world where players build beauty together rather than compete for resources.
